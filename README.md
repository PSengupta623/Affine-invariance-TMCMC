The study presents a two-stage Bayesian updating
In the first stage, an improved iterative model reduction is performed.
In the second stage, an affine-invariance based TMCMC sampling is performed.
Three examples are presented:
(i) A steel beam problem,
(ii) A FE building with large number of DOFs,
(iii) An eight Degree-of-freedom spring mass model for experimental verification
